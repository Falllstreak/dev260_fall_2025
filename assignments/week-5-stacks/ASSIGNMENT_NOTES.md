# Assignment 5: Browser Navigation System - Implementation Notes

**Name:** Edwin Pacheco

## Dual-Stack Pattern Understanding

**How the dual-stack pattern works for browser navigation:**
The forward and back stacks keep track of where you've been and where you can go next. Visiting a new page pushes the current page to the back stack and clears the forward stack, while going back or forward swaps pages between each stack.

## Challenges and Solutions

**Biggest challenge faced:**
I think keeping the new terminology in mind was the hardest for stacks. "Push, pop" sometimes get mixed up in my head.

**How you solved it:**
Testing after completing each method was the easiest way to keep everything straight within my head.

**Most confusing concept:**
I think it's the terminology that was hardest to keep track of.

## Code Quality

**What you're most proud of in your implementation:**
I really like how similar each of the functions felt to the Stacks lab. It helped to reinforce how this data type can be used.

**What you would improve if you had more time:**
I think it would be neat to have a saved history log, that isn't session based.

## Testing Approach

**How you tested your implementation:**
After each method I tested each feature to ensure that it worked. When I was done with all of it I also tested each feature again.

**Issues you discovered during testing:**
I only had some typos throughout, but ended up fixing them when the console yelled at me.

## Stretch Features

None implemented

## Time Spent

**Total time:** 5 hours

**Breakdown:**

- Understanding the assignment: [1/2 hour]
- Implementing the 6 methods: [3 hours]
- Testing and debugging: [1 hours]
- Writing these notes: [1/2 hour]

**Most time-consuming part:** Implementing the methods took the longest as it's still a new data type for me to be using. I had to reference the lab assignment a few times to make sure I was doing it correctly.
